# hello-world
Welcome to my world.
Hi,

I'm Christopher Oye. 

As a Technical Writer, I'm a tester and researcher. My job is to know what people want to achieve and precisely how to achieve it. Communicating that is the last step of the process and during that phase I aim to deliver clear, relevant, and accurate content to train and/or help others be more productive. I call this the writing process - which consist of installing, configuring, researching, and testing the product or software.
